Hello :)

This is some kind of Blackjack Game :)

I added functionality if player has greater number than dealer, dealer can draw more cards untill hits 21.

It was a little trickey to set right with Aces when dealer is chasing player's score.

I'm still learning JavaScript, this mini-project I found on Kenny Yip Coding YouTube channel,
and it was interesting to me, so I did it

Also, I done it with SASS, it is fun way to do CSS

Any advice is wellcome :)
